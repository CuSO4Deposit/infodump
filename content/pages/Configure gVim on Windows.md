## Install Vim-plug package manager

[Vim轻量高效插件管理神器vim-plug介绍-Vim插件(9)](https://vimjc.com/vim-plug.html)
[如何安装 Vim 插件](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/108697739)

### Install Vim-plug

First download the plug.vim and put it into the /autoload directory. I find there's already a plug.vim. Maybe it's built-in at Vim ver. 8.1.

Add these lines to _vimrc.

```vim
call plug#begin('D:\Program\ Files\ (x86)\Vim\vim81\pack')

call plug#end()
```

Restart Vim. An error indication:

[vim-plug] `git` executable not found. Most commands

It's because Win10 doesn't have a git as a built-in.[ref][win10下vim提示git executable not found怎么办](https://jingyan.baidu.com/article/08b6a59103fd2954a9092235.html)[/ref] Install Git.

### Install Git[ref] [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) [/ref]

Download Git 2.33.0.2-64-bit.exe. Install.
Restart Vim. The error indication disappears.

### Use Vim-plug to install plugin

Add a github link to the "call plug" mentioned. Then in any gVim window, use command mode, type :PlugInstall. The plugin will be automatically installed.

example:

[github author = "preservim" project = "nerdtree"][/github]

Its URL is [https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree). Add a line to _vimrc.

```vim
call plug#begin('D:\Program\ Files\ (x86)\Vim\vim81\pack')
Plug 'vim-syntastic/syntastic'
Plug 'preservim/nerdtree'
call plug#end()
```

Then open any file in gVim, type :PlugInstall, the plugin is automatically installed.

vim-plug window

## Plugin: YouCompleteMe

Installing YouCompleteMe is a very complicated and annoying process... But it's a very very powerful tool.

### Install YCM Plugin

[github author = "ycm-core" project = "YouCompleteMe#windows"][/github]

Install it by vim-plug.

### Upgrade Vim

[admonition title="Note" color="orange"]You should backup your theme and _vimrc before each time you upgrade Vim. They will be deleted.[/admonition]

When open any file, there's an error "YouCompleteMe unavailable: requires Vim 8.1.2269+". Sadly my version is 8.1.1, so I have to upgrade it. I'm afraid I have to re-edit lots of settings.

Download vim at github.

[github author="vim" project="vim-win32-installer"][/github]

The setup automatically deleted the old version. Glad that I don't have to change a lot. Download "plug.vim" for vim-plug and put it in /vim/vim82/autoload. Then do this change and reinstall plugins.

```vim
call plug#begin('D:\Program\ Files\ (x86)\Vim\vim81\pack')

->

call plug#begin('D:\Program\ Files\ (x86)\Vim\vim82\pack')
```

### Install  [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Install  [Cmake](https://cmake.org/download/)

### Microsoft VS2019

Already exist in the computer.

### Configure YCM

go to the directory D:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim82\pack\YouCompleteMe. Run cmd.

type in

python install.py --clangd-completer

Return:

File D:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim82\pack\YouCompleteMe\third_party\ycmd\build.py does not exist; you probably forgot to run:
git submodule update --init --recursive

Run the code it told, return:

fatal: could not get a repository handle for submodule 'third_party/ycmd'

Find a help here: [YouCompleteMe 安装过程记录 2021 - 码农教程](http://www.manongjc.com/detail/24-kxzqbxffbkqojjv.html)

Go to directory and run cmd, code:

git clone [https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex.git](https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex.git)

Return:

D:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim82\pack\YouCompleteMe\third_party\ycmd\mrab-regex>git clone [https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex.git](https://bitbucket.org/mrabarnett/mrab-regex.git)
Cloning into 'mrab-regex'...
Receiving objects: 100% (4768/4768), 48.52 MiB 1.01 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (756/756), done

return to the ycm dir, repeat the operation.

Things turn out that there are many files missing in my plugin dir. So I deleted them all, enable VPN and install YCM and it's core again. It works, in the ycmd dir many files appears. Then I tried again:

```
python install.py --clangd-completer
```

And python runs normally, despite some warnings.

Some warnings

And it automatically installed clang. Now the python install procejure is done.

Then set encoding=utf-8. Before doing this, in order to keep the menus from becoming messy code, i have to change language to English. That's to add this line [as the first line of _vimrc](https://zhidao.baidu.com/question/681772562373517612.html):

```vim
set langmenu=none
```

Then add set encoding=utf-8 to _vimrc, it works well.

Now when I open a file in vim, it errors:

YouCompleteMe unavailable: unable to load Python.

Go on finding solution, there's one saying that 32-bit vim isn't compatible with 64-bit python. So i should get a 64-bit vim. But first i'll try if editing the _vimrc can solve the problem.

type :echo has('python3'), it returns 0.

0

type :set pythonthreedll?, it returns python3.8.

But my python is 3.6. Add a line in the _vimrc.

```
set pythonthreedll=python36.dll
```

And it works. No error happens when i start vim.

Ohhhhhhhhh

YouCompleteMe is working properly now.

Conclusion: In my installing process, the biggest problem lies in the missing files. Next time installing YCM (especially at places where GitHub isn't completely accessible), pay more attention to files integrity.
