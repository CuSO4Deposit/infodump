This is just a simple record. About the configuring process on Windows, here is [another blog](/vim-configure-process-recording/).

## Version Info

Huge version with GTK3 GUI.

## .vimrc

[无插件Vim配置文件vimrc推荐与各VIM配置项解释](https://vimjc.com/vimrc.html)

```vim
" All system-wide defaults are set in $VIMRUNTIME/debian.vim and sourced by
" the call to :runtime you can find below.  If you wish to change any of those
" settings, you should do it in this file (/etc/vim/vimrc), since debian.vim
" will be overwritten everytime an upgrade of the vim packages is performed.
" It is recommended to make changes after sourcing debian.vim since it alters
" the value of the 'compatible' option.

runtime! debian.vim

" Vim will load $VIMRUNTIME/defaults.vim if the user does not have a vimrc.
" This happens after /etc/vim/vimrc(.local) are loaded, so it will override
" any settings in these files.
" If you don't want that to happen, uncomment the below line to prevent
" defaults.vim from being loaded.
let g:skip_defaults_vim = 1

" Uncomment the next line to make Vim more Vi-compatible
" NOTE: debian.vim sets 'nocompatible'.  Setting 'compatible' changes numerous
" options, so any other options should be set AFTER setting 'compatible'.
"set compatible

" Vim5 and later versions support syntax highlighting. Uncommenting the next
" line enables syntax highlighting by default.
if has("syntax")
syntax on
endif

" If using a dark background within the editing area and syntax highlighting
" turn on this option as well
"set background=dark

" Uncomment the following to have Vim jump to the last position when
" reopening a file
"au BufReadPost * if line("'\"") > 1 && line("'\"") <= line("$")  exe "normal! g'\""  endif

" Uncomment the following to have Vim load indentation rules and plugins
" according to the detected filetype.
"filetype plugin indent on

" The following are commented out as they cause vim to behave a lot
" differently from regular Vi. They are highly recommended though.
"set showcmd" Show (partial) command in status line.
"set showmatch" Show matching brackets.
"set ignorecase" Do case insensitive matching
"set smartcase" Do smart case matching
"set incsearch" Incremental search
"set autowrite" Automatically save before commands like :next and :make
"set hidden" Hide buffers when they are abandoned
"set mouse=a" Enable mouse usage (all modes)

" Source a global configuration file if available
if filereadable("/etc/vim/vimrc.local")

### Quick start

$ sudo apt install build-essential cmake vim-nox python3-dev

### Error message

FAILED

ERROR: the build failed.

NOTE: it is *highly* unlikely that this is a bug but rather that this is a problem with the configuration of your system or a missing dependency. Please carefully read CONTRIBUTING.md and if you're sure that it is a bug, please raise an issue on the issue tracker, including the entire output of this script (with --verbose) and the invocation line used to run it.

The installation failed; please see above for the actual error. In order to get more information, please re-run the command, adding the --verbose flag. If you think this is a bug and you raise an issue, you MUST include the *full verbose* output.

For example, run:/usr/bin/python3 /home/cuso4d/.vim/plugged/YouCompleteMe/third_party/ycmd/build.py --all --verbose

Add "--verbose", it will show detailed info when building.

### If you want C# support...

If you chose "install all support of YCM", or you want a C# support, caution:

**The source that built.py provided is a 404 page...**

I don't need a C# support. If you do, maybe you can download the file manually, or modify the build.py file.

### C-family support

python3 install.py --clangd-completer

#vim
